# StarRail Voice Sorting Scripts

Fork of [StarRail_Voice_Sorting_Scripts](https://github.com/AI-Hobbyist/StarRail_Voice_Sorting_Scripts)
for people who can't read Mandarin! The scripts have also been simplified. However, I have not touched the xlsx files and anyu of that functionality because I also can't read mandarin kekw
## Usage
Run each of the scripts in order, and pass the correct args! You can pass -h to all of the scripts for advice!
